change sol from tracker to control
	get rid of all recording features
	2 layer control scheme
		duplicate control on either side, load clips to separate layers
DONE move from pygame midi -> osc,
	so just assuming osc midi messages are coming in (from vvvv)

DONE fix looping/timeline control
	NAH	... probably think of better way to do whole dual-layers thing :/

DONE midi control is broken af...

	fix l/r mixup.... rly need a way to figure out a nicer way 
  OK just thought about what i was doin


stuff that's still broken -- 
FIXED ? works now so idk loop selection/deletion
FIXED   right's speedups (both types)
        right's loop type / on off
FIXED errors w/ qp after triggering an empty clip from midi

DONE  probably change vvvv out and looping stuff so that it just reads position values from resolume's osc out anyway...

Important info for midi out:
  The note number and channel that controls a backlight is the same as the message sent by that button
  push buttons 0-16 for brightness
  big buttons 0- red, 64 -  amber, 112 - green + 0-15 for intensity
