change sol from tracker to control
	get rid of all recording features
	2 layer control scheme
		duplicate control on either side, load clips to separate layers
DONE move from pygame midi -> osc,
	so just assuming osc midi messages are coming in (from vvvv)

DONE fix looping/timeline control
	NAH	... probably think of better way to do whole dual-layers thing :/

DONE midi control is broken af...

	fix l/r mixup.... rly need a way to figure out a nicer way 
  OK just thought about what i was doin


stuff that's still broken -- 
FIXED ? works now so idk loop selection/deletion
FIXED   right's speedups (both types)
        right's loop type / on off
FIXED errors w/ qp after triggering an empty clip from midi

probably change vvvv out and looping stuff so that it just reads position values from resolume's osc out anyway...
