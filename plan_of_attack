> add audio server part
	 combine audio gui with sol_gui
	 (kinda done)
> add recording part
	so that can represent all the various things 
	like clip/qp activation and copy pasta patterns : )

------------------
> begin recording part by adding clip activation @ qp for audio
	clip activ works, now need way to repr qp/patterns so can do next step too
		think of how to save/load this : )
	recording_quanta objects
	represented as little squares on timeline (w/in each layer) can click on em to open up popup
		that has checkboxes/dropdowns for stuff like
		> activate clip
		> activate cue
		> enable looping
		> etc
	then these little squares can be copied/cut/pasted over the entire timeline : )
> write posts
	> overview <
	audio
	control
	recording
> patterns, basically like so
    [clip]
    0 1 2 3
t 0 x
i 1   x
m 2 x
e 3     x

etc.
then can activate patterns with button press or put them @ qp for audio : )
