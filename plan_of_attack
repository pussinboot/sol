> add audio server part
	 combine audio gui with sol_gui
	 (kinda done) -> needs to look baller (y)

	so that can represent all the various things 
	like clip/qp activation and copy pasta patterns : )

	(y)
------------------
> begin recording part by adding clip activation @ qp for audio
	clip activ works, now need way to repr qp/patterns so can do next step too
		think of how to save/load this : )
		(y)
	recording_quanta objects
	represented as little squares on timeline (w/in each layer) can click on em to open up popup
		that has checkboxes/dropdowns for stuff like
		> activate clip
		> activate cue
		> enable looping
		> etc
	then these little squares can be copied/cut/pasted over the entire timeline : )
		do this

	overview 
	> audio <
	control
	recording
> patterns, basically like so
    [clip]
    0 1 2 3
t 0 x
i 1   x
m 2 x
e 3     x

etc.
then can activate patterns with button press or put them @ qp for audio : )
> not sure
===============================
new to-do
besides writing posts : )
> change in backend -> update the gui 
	(y)
> complete midi control..
	(y)
	still to-do
	clip_control
		playback/speedup changing (y)
		collection paging (y)
	looping/cues
		qp activate (y)
		lp select (y)
		loop on/off (y)
		looping type (y)
	rec control
		rec, playback (y)
	___ the below im not sure are needed ___
		, loop (?)
		channel ????


> find mysterious mem leak :^)
	found, but impossible to fix w/o abandoning tkinter (or can just make gui not show current audio/clip position :v[ )

> on clip change need to send what is current pos to our timeline control hax otherwise will get crazy jump

	which also may mean synchronizing it with overall recording by means of comparing to cur song time ??
	in which case can add this to existing recording system by setting it to only be recording from timeline_control
