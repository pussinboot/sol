##
# timeline
#
# waveform of audio file
# w/ beat grid

# playback
# w/ loop like in traktor (2,4,8,16 bars repeated)

# except 2nd part is what's cool
# record osc/midi actions
# so if select clip, show clip @ start of beat for ex (if snapped (which u choose w/ checkbox lol)) or at exact time u chose
# then can adjust where within the time loop clip starts
# on next iteration can playback or rerecord
# each time adds a layer so you can play back diff ones and choose which is best : )
# for now it'll just b a loop by loop kind of thing

# if you r playin around w/ clip like movin it back n forth
# plot movement on timeline
# then can do regression
# and play around w/ points of regression 2 make it nice n smooth 4 playback >:)
