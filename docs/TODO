# to finish for 2.1

    neo_clip_control is missing resize method : (

    the config fixes
        - make sure no lp is <= no qp....
        - select theme
    - themeing support

# 2.2
    - better midi, mayb kb support too
    - audio analysis see notes below

# to fix gui 
    - difference between doing something from the gui and actually doing it
    - doing something from the gui should ONLY tell magi what it did
    - magi handles the actual updating..
    - otherwise you get asked to do things multiple times...

# someday/maybe

support multiple midi devices
fx as Another Layer?
