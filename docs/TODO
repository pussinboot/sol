# to finish for 2.1

    - dark as my soul

    notebook tabs

    treeview heading active
    treeview border color

    replace scrollbar for collections tabs with ttk one ¯\_(ツ)_/¯



# 2.2
    - better midi, mayb kb support too
    - audio analysis see notes below

# to fix gui 
    - difference between doing something from the gui and actually doing it
    - doing something from the gui should ONLY tell magi what it did
    - magi handles the actual updating..
    - otherwise you get asked to do things multiple times...

# someday/maybe

support multiple midi devices
fx as Another Layer?
